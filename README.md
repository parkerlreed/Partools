Partools
========

A collection of various tools made by me

========
parcstract - script to extract various archive types to user specified folder

q3res - script to change the resolution variables of your Quake 3 config file. Requires a fairly recent ioquake3 build with -2 as a native res mode

giturl - very basic script to clone a git repo you may have memorized. Usage: giturl parkerlreed Partools

Everything requires yad, a much improved version of zenity. You can get yad from
