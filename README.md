Partools
========

A collection of various tools made by me

========
parcstract - script to extract various archive types to user specified folder

q3res - script to change the resolution variables of your Quake 3 config file. Requires a fairly recent ioquake3 build with -2 as a native res mode

giturl - very basic script to clone a git repo you may have memorized. Usage: giturl parkerlreed Partools

shoot- Screenshot script that auto uploads to imgur then copies the URL to the clipboard. Notifies after completion.

Everything requires yad, a much improved version of zenity. You can get yad from 
https://code.google.com/p/yad/
